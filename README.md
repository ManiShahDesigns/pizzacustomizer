# React Project: Pizza Customizer 

Customize your pizza with this app (I know the design and colors suck!). 

This app is made with create-react-app. 

I was inspired to build this app by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YNYhUapAzY but did not use/watch it to code the app. I only downloaded the images from and coded the app myself. 

### What I have used in this app:

1. React useState and useEffect hooks
2. Packages: React Bootstrap, React Router
3. JavaScript Higher Order Functions: .map(), .reduce(), .filter()
